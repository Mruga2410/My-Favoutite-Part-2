        <h2>My Favourite Hobby<br><span id="hobby">Reading Books</span></h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love reading. It helps me calm my mind and that's exactly what I need after a rough day or a long day. ðŸ“–ðŸ“š Reading is very relaxing so I don't need to work hard just to read a simple word, sentence or paragraph. It's very calming and engaging. I also like reading because it also counts as educational studies. Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. ðŸ“•ðŸ“” Besides, there's a lot of room for grammar and language development. When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time. Reading is an excercise for my mind. It opens doors to new knowledge and I've heard that kids who read often grow up to have better cognitive skills.</p>

        <p> My favourite books are 'The Midnight Gang' , 'Harry Potter series' , 'Geronimo Stilton Series' and 'Thea Stilton Series'. 
If you have not already read it then I'll tell you summary of 'The Midnight Gang' book. So basically what happens is a story of friendship, theatre and magic â€“ and of course, making dreams come true. When the clock strikes midnight most children are fast asleep, but for the Midnight Gang the journey is just beginning. The Midnight Gang is a secret gang of children who go on midnight adventures in the hospital. Tom follows them and his adventures begin, all whilst dressed in the frilly pink nighty Matron forces him to wear because he didn't bring his pyjamas. ... And, of course, the children.</p>
